# Dynamic-Retail-Dashboard
# Overview
This project involves the creation of a dynamic retail dashboard using Microsoft Excel, designed to visualize and analyze retail sales data across various dimensions. The dashboard connects to three main data tables-Orders, Returns, and People-and helps businesses gain insights into key sales performance metrics. This project is ideal for businesses looking to enhance their decision-making processes by analyzing data through dynamic visualizations and KPIs.

The dashboard includes key performance indicators (KPls) that track important metrics such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Quantity Sold, Number of Orders, and Profit Margin. These KPis are calculated and displayed on a centralized chart to ensure easy comparison and visualization. The project covers multiple problem statements that help break down the data into actionable insights.
